# Open-Source Model Selection

Based on the research, Vicuna has been selected as the free, open-source model for this Q&A assistant project. 

**Reasoning for selection:**
*   **Performance:** Vicuna is reported to achieve over 90% of the conversational prowess of ChatGPT and Google Bard, making it a strong candidate for Q&A tasks.
*   **Cost-efficiency:** It is highlighted as being cost-efficient, which aligns with the user's requirement for a free alternative to GPT-4.
*   **Community-driven:** Built by fine-tuning the LLaMA model with user-shared conversations, indicating active development and community support.

**Next Steps:**
*   Investigate how to integrate Vicuna into a Python application, specifically for Q&A.
*   Determine the best way to run Vicuna locally or access it via a free endpoint if available.
*   Adjust the project plan to reflect the integration of Vicuna instead of OpenAI GPT-4.
